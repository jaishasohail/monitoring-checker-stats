A JSON metrics file at the path defined in output_path (default data/sample_output.json)

5. Understanding The Output
Each object in the output array contains:

resource_id: the id from your configuration

response_time: response time in milliseconds for the last check

uptime_percentage: simplified uptime over the last check (100 for success, 0 for failure)

last_checked: timestamp of when the check was performed in UTC

status:

active when the check succeeded and response was fast

warning when the check succeeded but was slower than the configured threshold

down when the check failed

error_count: number of errors detected in the last run (0 or 1 in this implementation)

Example:
json[
  {
    "resource_id": "api_server_01",
    "response_time": 182,
    "uptime_percentage": 100.0,
    "last_checked": "2025-11-10T08:45:00Z",
    "status": "active",
    "error_count": 0
  }
]

6. Running Tests
The project uses pytest for tests.
From the project root:
bashpytest

This runs:
